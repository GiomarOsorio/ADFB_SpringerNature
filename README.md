**IMPORTANT:**
The Springer Nature platform has recently integrated a reCAPTCHA security system, so this script has stopped working.

It is a script that allows the user to automatically download the free books offered by Springer Nature at the following link: [Free access to a range of essential textbooks from all disciplines](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/news-events/all-news-articles/industry-news-initiatives/free-access-to-textbooks-for-institutions-affected-by-coronaviru/17855960).

## How to use

First download the executable for **GNU/Linux** or **Windows**, in [releases page](https://github.com/GiomarOsorio/ADFB_SpringerNature/releases)

Then you will need to download the file that contains the information of the books and links, this is offered by Springe Nature, once downloaded, rename the file to "dataBooks.xlsx" and put it in the same folder where the executable file is located, then start the program.

For Linux/Unix users type this command in the terminal, make sure it is in the file directory:
